/**
 * Passes every transition to `true` through immediately, but only passes a transition to `false`
 * through once it has held for [graceMillis] without flipping back to `true`.
 *
 * Written for [com.nastechresearch.jafta.AndCodeApplication]'s `"sessions"` wake-lock lease, which
 * follows [com.nastechresearch.jafta.data.repository.RuntimeActivityRepository]'s
 * `activeSessionIds`: that set is cleared the instant the runtime target leaves
 * [com.nastechresearch.jafta.runtime.RuntimeState.Connected]/`Connecting`, including for a
 * momentary SSE/HTTP blip during a long agent run. Releasing the lease - and with it the wake lock
 * - on that same instant lets the device suspend mid-run and freezes the proot child, which is
 * exactly the failure the wake-lock rework exists to prevent. Debouncing only the false edge means
 * a real end (the flag staying `false` for the whole grace window) still releases the lease
 * promptly, while a blip that recovers within the window never releases it at all -
 * `activeSessionIds` itself is untouched, so every other consumer of it still sees the drop
 * immediately; only this one downstream lease waits it out.
 *
 * Implemented as a plain, testable [Flow] transform - not inline in the application class - so the
 * "blip vs. real end" distinction can be verified with a virtual clock instead of a live wake lock.
 * Runs the receiving side of a [Channel.CONFLATED] buffer in a single coroutine so `current` is
 * never touched from more than one thread at a time, unlike a shared `var` written from both a
 * collector and a delayed callback would be.
