<!-- Keep this short. Delete anything that doesn't apply. -->

## What this changes

<!-- One paragraph. What was wrong or missing, and what the patch does about it. -->

## Why this way

<!-- Only if the approach isn't obvious: what you rejected and why. -->

## How you verified it

<!-- Which command, on what. "Tests pass" is weaker than "test X fails without
     this patch and passes with it". If you ran it on a device, say which. -->

```bash
ruff check jafta/ tests/ && npx pyright jafta/bus jafta/command jafta/runtime jafta/session jafta/snapshot jafta/gateway_runtime.py && pytest -q
```
