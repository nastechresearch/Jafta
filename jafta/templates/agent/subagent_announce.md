[Subagent '{{ label }}' {{ status_text }}]

Task: {{ task }}

Result:
{{ result }}

{% if silent %}This subagent was working for a SILENT scheduled check, and **you are the turn that decides**. Whatever you write here is not delivered to the user and nobody reads it; the only way to reach them is the `message` tool.

The check delegated the work precisely because it could not know the answer yet — this result is the answer. Judge it against the condition the check was created for:

- Condition met, or an error that blocks the check → call `message` with the user-facing text only.
- Everything normal, nothing crossed, nothing changed since the last run → call `nothing_to_report` and end the turn. That tool delivers nothing and reaches nobody, and it is the expected outcome of most runs. Never send filler like "All clear.", "All done.", "check in progress" or "nothing to report".

Do not mention the subagent, the check, or your decision about whether to speak.
{% else %}Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). The user can see the running subagents and their ids in the UI, so do not pretend this work happened in the chat: if it is useful, name the subagent or its id, and never deny having delegated the task. Just do not narrate the mechanics they can already see.
