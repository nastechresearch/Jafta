# Third-Party Notices

Jafta redistributes the third-party components listed below. Each keeps its own
license; the AGPL-3.0 that covers Jafta itself does not apply to them. Full
license texts live next to the files they cover, at the paths given.

## Bundled WebUI assets

Vendored under `jafta/templates/ui/assets/vendor/` and shipped inside the APK.
Nothing is fetched from a CDN at runtime — the WebUI has no outbound asset
loads, which is why these are vendored in the first place.

| Component | Version | License | License text |
|---|---|---|---|
| [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) | 3.2.4 | Apache-2.0 **or** MPL-2.0 | `vendor/dompurify@3/LICENSE` |
| [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) | 15.0.7 | MIT | `vendor/marked@15.0.7/LICENSE` |
| [highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js) | 11.11.1 | BSD-3-Clause | `vendor/highlight.js@11.11.1/LICENSE` |
| [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX) | 0.16.10 | MIT | `vendor/katex@0.16.10/LICENSE` |
| [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) | 10.9.6 | MIT | `vendor/mermaid@10/LICENSE` |
| [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) | 7.9.0 | ISC | `vendor/d3@7/LICENSE` |
| [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror5) | 5.65.16 | MIT | `vendor/codemirror@5.65.16/LICENSE` |
| [Tabler Icons](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) (webfont) | 3.19.0 | MIT | `vendor/@tabler/icons-webfont@3.19.0/LICENSE` |

The KaTeX distribution includes its own web fonts under
`katex@0.16.10/dist/fonts/`; they are covered by the KaTeX license above. Only
the `.woff2` faces are shipped: the stylesheet lists woff2 first and the Android
WebView supports it, so the `.ttf` and `.woff` copies were never fetched — 700 kB
of APK that nothing could open.

## Bundled fonts

Self-hosted under `jafta/templates/ui/assets/vendor/fonts/`. All are licensed
under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://openfontlicense.org); the full
OFL text and the per-font copyright notices are in `vendor/fonts/LICENSE.txt`.

- **UI fonts** — Inter, Fira Code.
- **Per-theme display fonts** (`theme-fonts.css`) — Tenor Sans, Orbitron,
  Shippori Mincho, Baloo 2, Bangers, Comic Neue, Fredoka, Marcellus.

## Bundled Python packages

Chaquopy installs the wheels pinned in `requirements-android.lock.txt` into the
APK at build time: `httpx`, `websockets`, `loguru`, `json-repair`, `jinja2`,
`filelock`, `markdown`, `pyyaml`, `pypdf`, `typing-extensions`, `tzdata`. All are pure-Python and resolve from public PyPI — none is local or
patched. Each is governed by its own license, available in the installed
wheel's metadata and in its upstream repository.

The APK also embeds a CPython 3.11 runtime and the Chaquopy support layer, both
supplied by the [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/) Gradle plugin.
[Chaquopy is MIT-licensed](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/license/) — free and
open source since 12.0.1, with no remaining license restrictions — and CPython
is under the Python Software Foundation License. Both are compatible with this
project's AGPL-3.0 grant.

## Bundled Android libraries — SSH

The SSH client is native rather than Python. Both libraries below are plain
Java, resolve from Maven Central and are shipped inside the APK.

| Component | Version | License |
|---|---|---|
| [JSch (mwiede fork)](https://github.com/mwiede/jsch) | 2.28.6 | BSD-3-Clause, plus the bundled JZlib (BSD) and jBCrypt (ISC) notices carried in the jar |
| [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) (`bcprov-jdk18on`) | 1.85 | Bouncy Castle Licence (MIT-style) |

Bouncy Castle is not optional. Android's own `BC` provider is a reduced build
without Ed25519, and X25519 only reached Conscrypt in Android 14 while this app
supports API 26 — so without it neither the modern key exchange every current
server negotiates nor ed25519 keys would work at all.

Both licenses are permissive and compatible with this project's AGPL-3.0 grant.

## Mascot artwork

The Jafta mascot artwork (`android/image_source/`, and the WebP poses derived
from it under `jafta/templates/ui/assets/`) is original work, copyright © 2026
Ludovico Ragno, and is **not** covered by the AGPL grant — see
[TRADEMARK.md](./TRADEMARK.md).
