# Screenshots for a mobile app have to come from the device: a desktop browser
# pointed at the gateway renders different fonts, a different aspect ratio and
# no Android system bars, so it misrepresents the product.
#
# The script prompts you to put the app in the right state, then grabs the
# framebuffer. Nothing is cropped or retouched — what the phone shows is what
# lands in docs/img/.
