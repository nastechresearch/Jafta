# Memory and Dream

Jafta keeps two very different kinds of memory: the live conversation you're having right now, and a set of durable text files that survive across chats, app restarts, and (if you back up) phone changes.

One background process maintains those files: **Dream** distils your conversations into what Jafta knows about you and your work. [Your wikis](./wiki.md) are not memory in this sense — they are something you wrote down — and they reach the prompt differently: as a list of names and scopes, read from disk on every turn (see [How Jafta knows which wikis you have](#how-jafta-knows-which-wikis-you-have)).

## The shape of memory

Jafta does not treat memory as one giant file. It separates it into layers, because different kinds of remembering deserve different tools:

- The live chat — what you're seeing on screen right now.
- `memory/history.jsonl` — a running archive of compressed past turns.
- `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/MEMORY.md` — the durable knowledge files that Jafta actually reads at the start of every conversation.

This keeps a single chat fast in the moment, while still letting Jafta build up a durable picture of you and the project over weeks of use.

## The two-phase pipeline

Memory moves through Jafta in two stages, and both have to run before something you said becomes part of Jafta's long-term knowledge.

```text
live chat  →  Consolidator  →  memory/history.jsonl  →  Dream (every 2h)  →  MEMORY.md / USER.md / SOUL.md / skills
```

### Stage 1: the Consolidator (context compaction)

While you chat, Jafta is not trying to carry every old message forever. When the conversation grows large enough to pressure the model's context window, or when the session has been idle long enough, the Consolidator summarizes the oldest safe slice of the conversation with an LLM call and appends that summary to `memory/history.jsonl`.

This file is:

- append-only
- cursor-based (each write gets a numeric cursor so later steps know what's new)
- optimized for machine consumption first, human inspection second

Each line is a JSON object, roughly:

```json
{"cursor": 42, "timestamp": "2026-04-03 00:02", "content": "- User prefers dark mode\n- Decided to use PostgreSQL"}
```

It is not the final memory — it's the raw material Dream later shapes into something durable. Two triggers feed it:

- **Token pressure**: once the conversation gets close to filling the configured context window, older messages are summarized and archived so the newest turns keep fitting.
- **Idle timeout**: if the chat has been idle for a while (15 minutes by default — see [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md) for `idleCompactAfterMinutes`), the session is auto-compacted the same way.

If the LLM call that produces the summary fails, nothing is thrown away. Idle compaction of the personal chat simply doesn't happen: the conversation is left intact and the compaction is retried about ten minutes later. Token-pressure compaction leaves the slice unconsolidated and retries on the next turn; only when it has failed in **three turns in a row** on the same session does it fall back to a raw `[RAW]` dump of the messages into `history.jsonl` and move on — less polish, but the content is kept. What counts is turns, not attempts: a turn tries more than once (before the prompt, after saving, after an overflow), and those retries count as one failure. The count lives in memory, so an app restart starts it again from zero.

### Stage 2: Dream

Dream is the slower, more thoughtful layer. By default it runs automatically every 2 hours while the app is running, and you can also trigger it on demand with `/dream`.

Each Dream run:

1. Reads new, unprocessed entries from `memory/history.jsonl`, each one **whole** — up to 20 entries per run, within a budget of 16,000 characters. An entry that doesn't fit waits for the next run instead of being cut; the first entry of a run is always read, even if it alone is longer than the budget.
2. Reads the current `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `memory/MEMORY.md`.
3. Edits those long-term files — and skill files under `workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — surgically, in a single pass, using a restricted set of file-editing tools.

Dream doesn't rewrite everything from scratch; it makes the smallest honest change that keeps memory coherent. That's why Jafta's memory is interpretive, not just archival — and also why Dream **prunes as well as adds**. Its instructions tell it to be "ruthless about pruning": removing stale, duplicated, or resolved content is treated as just as important as writing new facts. A fact you thought was permanently saved can be trimmed, merged, or rewritten in a later Dream pass if Jafta judges it no longer earns its place.

Because of that, Jafta takes a workspace snapshot right before every Dream run. If Dream ever prunes or rewrites something you wanted kept, that snapshot is your way back — see [Backup and restore](./backup.md) for how to browse and restore snapshots. The snapshot attempt is best-effort: if it fails for some reason, Dream still runs (the safety net just wouldn't be there for that one pass).

Dream's cursor into `history.jsonl` only advances once a run completes cleanly **and** actually manages to write something (or has nothing to write in the first place). If Dream gets blocked or a write fails partway through, the cursor stays put and those entries are retried on the next run — nothing is silently skipped.

A run reads a *window* of unprocessed entries — at most 20, and at most 16,000 characters of whole entries (an entry is never cut; the first one always fits). Personal and [notebook](./projects.md) entries are never mixed in one batch, because they get different instructions and different tools. When the window holds both kinds, it is split: a first batch takes every entry of the oldest entry's kind, and a second batch, on the same window, takes the others. There is still a single cursor. It moves to the end of the window only when both batches land. If only the first lands, the cursor stops after the uninterrupted run of that kind at the start of the window, and everything past it comes back next run — the facts the first batch already saved are found on disk and reported as already present, which costs a re-read, not a fact.

"Wrote something" is not the same as "saved the batch", and the difference is worth stating because it cost real entries. A run can obey the first half of an over-budget refusal — free some space by rewriting an existing line shorter — and then stop without adding the new fact. Every counter reads healthy: a write succeeded, no refusal is outstanding. So Dream also checks, at the end of each run, whether **any** memory file grew. If a memory file was already near its budget when the run started, the batch carried facts tagged for retention, and nothing grew, the cursor is held and those entries come back next run, which is also what pulls in the review pass that frees room. The "near its budget" part is what keeps this quiet: without it the check fires on every batch of facts Jafta already knows, which is most of them — the consolidator re-extracts the same facts each pass. Below that mark, a run that adds nothing is believed. This is a size heuristic, not a proof: a run that legitimately replaces a line with a shorter one carrying the new fact reads as "nothing landed" and gets replayed a few times. That is the cheap direction to be wrong in — the expensive one is losing the fact — and the replay is bounded: after four held runs Dream gives up on the batch, advances, and the stuck alarm has already fired.

## Why Dream can say "nothing to process"

If you run `/dream` on a chat that just started, or one that's still short, Jafta will reply that there's no conversation history to process yet. This is expected, not a bug: Dream only reads from `memory/history.jsonl`, and fresh conversations only reach that file *after* the Consolidator has compacted them (see Stage 1 above). A short, still-active chat simply hasn't produced any compacted history for Dream to read yet.

Concretely, `/dream` will tell you this and suggest enabling automatic idle compaction (`idleCompactAfterMinutes`) so completed chats become Dream input on their own, or waiting until the current chat actually gets compacted.

## How Jafta knows which wikis you have

The system prompt of the personal chat carries a `## Wikis` block: one line per folder under `workspace/wikis/`, with the wiki's name, its one-line scope (the `summary:` in its `AGENTS.md`) and the path of its index. It is rendered from disk on every turn — there is no file behind it, nothing to rebuild and nothing that can fall behind: a wiki you created a minute ago is already listed.

That is deliberately all it carries. The prompt knows your wikis by name and scope; the content is read when a question touches it — Jafta opens `wikis/<name>/wiki/index.md` before answering about one of those subjects, and greps `wikis/` when she needs to know whether something is recorded anywhere. A wiki whose scope line is missing shows up as `(no scope set)`, on purpose: a wiki whose one line is not enough to decide whether to open it is a wiki that needs a scope, or needs splitting.

Two things follow. The block is withheld from [notebook](./projects.md) conversations and from [gardener](./gardener.md) passes — inside a notebook, the list of your other subjects is exactly the cross-project inventory the boundary keeps out. And there is no compiled directory of entities any more: versions before 0.10.0 built one from the wikis with a periodic job (Atlas) into `memory/WIKI.md`. That job, its config block and its files are removed at the first start of a version without it; nothing you wrote is touched.

## The files

```text
workspace/
├── SOUL.md              # The bot's long-term voice, behavior rules, tool-use strategy
├── USER.md               # Stable knowledge about you: identity, preferences, communication style
└── memory/
    ├── MEMORY.md         # Project facts, decisions, and durable context
    ├── history.jsonl     # Append-only history summaries (Consolidator output)
    ├── .cursor           # Consolidator write cursor
    └── .dream_cursor     # Dream read cursor
```

These files play different roles:

- `SOUL.md` remembers how Jafta should behave and sound — guardrails, interaction patterns, tool-use strategy.
- `.jafta/soul_rules.md` holds the standing rules **you** wrote, from **Settings → Jafta**. Dream's write registry allows exactly `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md` and `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, so no consolidation pass can touch that file; a marked block inside `SOUL.md` carries a copy, which is what the prompt reads, and it is re-projected after every pass. A line a pass wrote inside that block is not yours, so the re-projection moves it right after the block instead of deleting it. Emptying the box removes both.
- `USER.md` remembers who you are and what you prefer — identity, habits, language, tone, reply length.
- `MEMORY.md` remembers what remains true about the work itself — goals, decisions, infrastructure.
- `history.jsonl` remembers what happened on the way there, as compressed, timestamped summaries.
- Recurring workflows can also be promoted into `workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` by Dream, rather than staying as prose inside `MEMORY.md` or `USER.md`.

All of these are plain text in your workspace. You can read them, edit them by hand, or just ask Jafta to change something in them — nothing about memory is hidden behind a locked format.

### `history.jsonl` instead of a plain history file

`history.jsonl` replaced an older, more casual "history as prose" format because it needed to be an operational substrate, not just pleasant reading. The JSON-lines format gives Jafta stable incremental cursors, safer machine parsing, easier batching per Dream run, and a cleaner boundary between raw history and curated knowledge. It's capped at **1000 entries**; once the cap is reached, the oldest entries are dropped to make room for new ones as the file is compacted.

You can search it yourself with the `python_exec` tool or by asking Jafta to `grep` it, if you ever want to see exactly what got archived. Jafta reads it herself with the `recall_history` tool, from the personal chat only (inside a project the tool refuses). That tool lists **every** entry in the file, not just the personal chat's: the journals of your projects (notebooks) are included, and so are entries hidden from the prompt with `prompt_visible=False` — such as the conversation `/new` just archived.

## What Jafta actually remembers when you open a new chat

At the start of every conversation, Jafta's system prompt includes:

- `SOUL.md` and `USER.md`, loaded as bootstrap files.
- `MEMORY.md`, if it has real content (an untouched template file isn't injected).
- The `## Wikis` block: one line per wiki under `workspace/wikis/` — its name and one-line scope — rendered from disk at every build. It sits under the same "Memory" heading as `MEMORY.md` but is injected independently — an untouched `MEMORY.md` doesn't suppress it — and never inside a project conversation.
- Any history entries from `memory/history.jsonl` that Dream hasn't processed yet (capped to the last 50 entries / roughly 8,000 tokens of text) — this is the bridge between "compacted but not yet dreamed" and the durable files.

So a brand-new chat isn't a blank slate: it inherits your durable profile and project notes from the last Dream pass, plus whatever's been compacted since then but not yet folded in.

Note the asymmetry in that list. The pending history is *capped* at injection time; `SOUL.md`, `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` are injected **whole**, at whatever length they happen to be, on every single turn. That is on purpose — see [The budgets bound what Dream writes, not what a turn pays](#the-budgets-bound-what-dream-writes-not-what-a-turn-pays).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/dream` | Runs Dream immediately instead of waiting for the next scheduled pass. Replies "Dreaming..." right away, then follows up with the outcome once it finishes (completed and how long it took; completed but consolidated nothing from its batch, in which case the memory cursor stays put and those entries come back next run; completed but wrote nothing because its attempts were blocked or refused; did not complete; failed; or nothing to process). If another Dream cycle is already running it does not start a second one and says so instead of "Dreaming...". The exact texts are in [Slash commands](./slash-commands.md#dream--run-memory-consolidation-now). When a review pass ran first, the note also says how many characters it freed, how many facts it moved into `memory/archive/` (with the ids to ask for them back), and how many writes were refused by a size budget and never landed — that last one is usually the explanation for "nothing was freed". |

It is a verb: it does something now, and takes no settings. It is also a **personal-chat command** — inside a [notebook](./projects.md) it is refused. See [Slash commands](./slash-commands.md#where-a-command-works).

## The knobs: the workshop's Memory drawer

The budgets and the review cadence used to be arguments of `/dream`. They are settings, so they live in the workshop's **Memory** drawer (the workshop opens from the bottom of the home's Settings page), next to what they act on — the file sizes under «How much she remembers», the schedule and review cadence under «Dream — who fills those three files»:

| Control | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Periodic consolidation | Whether Dream runs on its own, and how many hours between runs. Turning it on or off applies immediately — no restart. |
| Review pass every N runs | How often the shrinking pass runs. Below **12** the screen asks for an explicit confirmation before writing it, with the measured reason in the dialog. [Why there is a floor.](#the-review-cadence-has-a-floor-of-12-and-it-is-enforced) |
| File budgets | The group shows each file — `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md` — with **what it currently measures** against its budget, so the budget is chosen from the real number rather than guessed. The three fields themselves sit behind **Change the budgets**. `0` means measure and never refuse. |

Every change goes through the config write funnel and takes effect on the next run. That surface exists because raising a default in a new version of the app does **not** reach a `config.json` that has already been written: the file wins, so there has to be a way to change it that is not a root shell.

## Configuration

Dream's configuration lives under `agents.defaults.dream` in `config.json`, and it is much smaller than older documentation for this project suggested — there is no `cron`, `modelOverride`, or `maxBatchSize` field. Six fields exist: two for scheduling, and four that give the memory files a size to aim at.

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "dream": {
        "enabled": true,
        "intervalH": 2,
        "memoryBudgetChars": 3000,
        "userBudgetChars": 4000,
        "soulBudgetChars": 0,
        "reviewEveryRuns": 12
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning | Default |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | Whether the periodic Dream job is registered at all. | `true` |
| `intervalH` | How often Dream runs automatically, in hours. Internally this becomes an "every N hours" schedule. | `2` |
| `memoryBudgetChars` | Target size for `memory/MEMORY.md`, in characters. Dream sees how full the file is in every prompt, and a Dream write that would push it further over the line is refused — a write that *shrinks* it is always allowed, or an over-budget file could never be pruned. `0` means "measure, don't enforce". | `3000` |
| `userBudgetChars` | The same for `USER.md`. It ships 1,000 characters higher than `MEMORY.md` because identity facts said inside notebooks also land here (see the gotcha on notebook conversations below). | `4000` |
| `soulBudgetChars` | The same for `SOUL.md` — and it ships at `0` on purpose. That file mixes Jafta's identity, which must never be pruned, with notes that belong elsewhere, and a size limit cannot tell the two apart. The review pass reads before it decides; the limit does not. The block with your own standing rules is not counted: the budget bounds what Dream writes, and those lines are yours. | `0` |
| `reviewEveryRuns` | Every how many Dream runs the **review pass** runs: a pass whose only job is to make the files smaller, rather than to add to them. At the default interval, twelve runs is about once a day. **Settings asks for a confirmation below 12** — see below. Editing `config.json` by hand is not blocked (the schema still accepts any value from `1` up, so a restored config always loads), but 12 is the number the design assumes. | `12` |

The budgets are counted in **characters**, not tokens, because that is the only unit the model can count while it is writing.

**These caps bind Dream, not Jafta.** The refusal is mounted only on the tools Dream's own runs get. The tools Jafta uses while you are talking to her carry no size guard at all, so a chat turn can write past a budget and nothing stops it — measured on a real device at 2,399 characters against a cap of 2,400. That is deliberate. A refusal in the middle of a conversation would land on the one writer that has you sitting there, and it would trade a visible failure for an invisible one: the thing you just asked Jafta to remember would quietly not be saved. So for the main agent the numbers are **advisory** — the size the review pass aims for, not a wall. They are enforced where the writer is unattended and has a review pass behind it to make room.

The cost of that choice is worth knowing: a chat turn can leave a file saturated, and it is Dream that then finds no room. If you see Dream reporting that it consolidated nothing, a file already at its cap is the first thing to check — the workshop's Memory drawer shows each file's size against its budget.

**Being over budget is not an error.** It means the next thing Dream wants to add has to wait for the review pass to make room — usually by *moving* something to where it belongs (a task specification to a skill file, project context to `MEMORY.md`) rather than by forgetting it.

### The review cadence has a floor of 12, and it is enforced

A cadence below **12** runs does not get written without an explicit confirmation, and the server refuses it whatever asks — the floor is not a client-side politeness. The reason is that below that the review passes start meeting each other: the second one lands on a file the first has already pruned, and it keeps looking for things to remove. Measured on a real device, two consecutive passes took `USER.md` from 3,524 characters to 1,626 — 31% of that on the second pass alone — and a forced pass on a later build removed five real entries: two open questions, a plan, a biographical detail and one insight.

Losing them is no longer possible. Every entry that leaves `USER.md` or `memory/MEMORY.md` is written to `memory/archive/` before the shrinking write lands, whichever tool does the shrinking — measured over two runs at `reviewEveryRuns: 1`, ten entries were archived and nothing was lost. So the floor is not there to stop deletion any more. It is there because a faster cadence spends tokens on every Dream run, unattended, for pruning that has nothing left to prune, and 12 is the cadence the rest of the design assumes.

If you want a faster cadence anyway — measuring on a real device is the reason this path exists — typing a value below the floor in the workshop's Memory drawer raises a dialog carrying those measurements, and only an explicit yes writes it. Setting it back to 12 needs no confirmation.

It used to be a confirmation *phrase* to retype (`/dream budget review 1 i-accept-back-to-back-reviews`), for the same reason the dialog exists now: it should be something you decide, not something that gets added for you. A tap that has just read the numbers is that decision; a tap that has not is why the dialog carries them.

### The budgets bound what Dream writes, not what a turn pays

These are budgets on the *files*, not on the prompt. There is no read-side cap on `SOUL.md`, `USER.md` or `memory/MEMORY.md`: each one is injected into the system prompt whole, on every turn, however long it has become — and `SOUL.md` has no write-side budget either, since `soulBudgetChars` ships at `0`. Everything else injected alongside them *is* capped: the unprocessed history at ~8,000, the page content inside a [notebook](./projects.md) at 6,000 characters. The three durable files are the deliberate exception. (`AGENTS.md` is a fourth file loaded unfiltered, and it has no budget and no curator at all — that one is an open question, not a decision.)

The reason is that a cap at injection time would be a limit with nobody behind it. What actually keeps these files small is the review pass: it reads a file before deciding, and *moves* what doesn't belong there rather than dropping it. That is what took `SOUL.md` from 6,447 characters to about 2,100 in under a week — by relocating platform notes into the app's own bundled templates, where they get rewritten at every boot. A cap can't do that. It can't tell Jafta's identity from a stale implementation note; it would cut whichever of the two happens to sit at the end of the file, on every turn, and report it to nobody who could act. A refused write, by contrast, leaves the file intact and tells the writer, the log, the counters and — if it keeps happening — you.

The other half of the reason is that these files are terminal. A truncated line in the `## Wikis` block costs you a pointer, and the wiki it named is still one `read_file` away; the tail of `USER.md` is not written down anywhere else, so a "the rest is over there" notice would have nothing to point at.

What that leaves you responsible for: the system prompt is a fixed cost, so if these files ever do get big, it's the live conversation that gets compacted earlier to make room. The sizes in the workshop's Memory drawer are the numbers to watch, and they are numbers to act on rather than a wall that will act for you.

### Related settings, and where to change them

Related settings that shape *when* material reaches Dream in the first place (not Dream-specific, but relevant here) live under `agents.defaults` too: `idleCompactAfterMinutes` (idle-triggered compaction, default 15 minutes), `maxMessages` (default 120), and the consolidation ratio that controls how aggressively old messages are summarized (default 0.5). See [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md) for the full reference.

The workshop's **Memory** drawer covers Dream itself: the on/off switch, the interval, the review cadence, and the three file budgets with their current sizes. What is still config-only is the material *around* it — the compaction thresholds in this paragraph — which can only be changed by editing `config.json` directly. The memory files themselves need no special mode to see: `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`, and `memory/history.jsonl` are all visible in the file browser («The real files», at the bottom of the same drawer). What the file browser never lists are dotfiles and a handful of runtime-internal paths (`config.json`, `agent/`, `cron/`, `sessions/`, `ui/`) — including the `memory/.cursor` and `memory/.dream_cursor` cursor files, which are dotfiles. There is no switch to reveal them any more: the old developer-mode toggle was removed.

## Gotchas worth knowing

- **"Every 2 hours" is a floor, not a promise.** Since 0.6.0 the deadline survives an app restart and a run missed while the app was dead is caught up shortly after it comes back — before that, every restart pushed it out by another 2 hours. The second half of the problem was doze: with the screen off the phone suspends, and the timer Dream was waiting on stops advancing with it, so the gap stretched even on a process that had stayed alive for hours. Since 0.6.6 the scheduler also asks Android to wake the phone at the next deadline, and holds the CPU awake for the length of the run itself, so a consolidation pass no longer has to wait for the phone to wake on its own or risk freezing halfway through. It is still a floor: an alarm the OS downgrades to inexact, or a battery manager that kills the app outright, will still push a run later. See [Scheduling and proactivity](./scheduling.md#what-066-changed-and-what-it-didnt) for what is and isn't guaranteed, and «Background activity» in the workshop's Brain drawer for whether Jafta has actually been up.
- **A notebook conversation reaches `USER.md`, and nothing else.** A [notebook](./projects.md) conversation is archived into `memory/history.jsonl` too, under its own session key. Those entries never enter a turn's prompt, and Dream digests them in a separate batch whose only write tool is the entry tool on `USER.md`: an identity fact about you said inside a project can land there, but nothing can reach `MEMORY.md` or `SOUL.md`, and the project's own content stays in the project, which remembers by writing pages in its own folder.
- **Dream prunes, not just adds.** Expect Jafta's memory to occasionally lose detail on purpose — that's Dream doing its job, not corruption. The pre-Dream snapshot is there specifically so a bad prune is recoverable.
- **`/dream` on a short or fresh chat will say there's nothing to process.** That's because Dream reads `memory/history.jsonl`, not the live chat — see above.
- **Memory files are always visible in the file browser.** If you go looking for `MEMORY.md` under «The real files» and don't see it, the more likely explanation is that it's still an untouched template with no real content yet. Only dotfiles and runtime-internal folders like `agent/`, `cron/`, and `sessions/` are hidden, and there is no switch that reveals them.
- **If the provider is down when the Consolidator needs to summarize, the conversation waits.** Idle compaction leaves the chat intact and retries later; token-pressure compaction retries on the next turn and degrades to a raw `[RAW]` dump only after three turns in a row have failed — you don't lose the content, but a dump won't read as nicely as a summary.
- **Dream's own model, interval, and batch size are not independently configurable today** — despite what an earlier draft of this documentation implied, there is no `modelOverride` field: Dream always uses the same model as your main agent, and there is no `maxBatchSize` or `cron` override to reach for.

## In practice

What this design means in daily use:

- Conversations stay fast without carrying infinite context.
- Durable facts about you and your projects get clearer over time instead of noisier, because Dream is actively editing, not just appending.
- You can force a consolidation pass with `/dream` whenever you want, and you can always recover a pruning mistake from a pre-Dream snapshot.

See also [Scheduling and proactivity](./scheduling.md) for how the Dream job relates to other background jobs (heartbeat, reminders), and [Backup and restore](./backup.md) for how workspace snapshots work.
