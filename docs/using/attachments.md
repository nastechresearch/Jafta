# Files and attachments

You can attach photos, camera shots, and any other file to a chat message; this page covers how attaching works, what limits apply, what the model actually gets to see, and how to open files back out of the chat.

## Attaching something

Tap the paperclip button in the composer (in the home and in the workshop's Console alike). It opens the Android system chooser — the same picker any app uses — so you get your file manager, your gallery, and a "take a photo" option all in one place. Jafta does not request the `CAMERA` permission for this: taking a photo is delegated entirely to your phone's own camera app, which hands the finished picture back to Jafta.

In the workshop's Console the paperclip (together with the **New chat** button beside it) hides itself once you start typing text, and reappears when the input is empty again; in the home it stays where it is.

You can send a message that is attachments only, with no text at all — an empty message is only rejected if it has neither text nor attachments.

Before you hit send, each attachment shows up in the composer as a thumbnail (images) or a small chip with a filename (everything else). Tap the small "×" on any of them to drop it from the message before sending — nothing has been uploaded yet at that point.

## Limits per message

Jafta enforces the same limits on both the phone (composer) and the gateway (server), so a well-formed message never gets silently truncated after the fact — see the notes below for what happens when you go over.

| Kind | Max count per message | Max size each | Recognized formats |
|---|---|---|---|
| Images | 4 | 8 MB | PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF only |
| Generic files | 4 | 20 MB | anything |
| Video | 1 | 20 MB | MP4, WebM, QuickTime (.mov) |

"Image" here is a strict allowlist by MIME type (or, when the camera hands back a file with no MIME type, by file extension): PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF. **SVG is not on that list** — an attached SVG is treated as a generic file, never rendered inline as an image.

All attachments, once sent, are saved on the device under `workspace/uploads/` — they're ordinary files in your workspace, visible and browsable from the workshop's Memory drawer, under **The real files** (see [Tour of the WebUI](webui-tour.md)) and included in workspace backups and snapshots (see [Backup and restore](backup.md)).

## What the model actually sees

Attaching a file doesn't mean the model reads all of it, all the time — Jafta is deliberately conservative about what goes into every turn's context:

- **Images** are sent to the model as vision input, if the active model supports vision.
- **Small text files and PDFs** (under 512 KB) have their text extracted and inlined directly into your message, so the model sees the content immediately without needing to use a tool. Extractable text types: `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`/`.htm`, `.log`, `.yaml`/`.yml`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.cfg`, plus `.pdf`. Extracted text is capped at 200,000 characters — anything longer is cut off with a `(truncated, N chars total)` note.
- **Everything else** — binaries, files over 512 KB, or anything whose extraction failed — is *not* read up front. Instead the model gets a plain reference in the turn, `[Attachment: <path>]`, and can open the file itself later with its own file tools (see [Tool reference](../reference/tools.md)) if it decides it needs to.

This inline-extraction behavior is controlled by the `extractDocumentText` config key, which defaults to **false** (the on-demand-reference behavior above). Setting it to `true` switches to a legacy mode that force-extracts text from documents up to 50 MB instead of skipping straight to a reference above 512 KB — but the 200,000-character cap on extracted text still applies either way; this key is config-only today, there's no UI toggle for it — see [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

If the active model doesn't support vision, Jafta drops the attached images and retries with text only, then appends a visible warning to its reply so it doesn't look like the attachment was silently ignored. The warning is in English whatever the phone's language, because it is saved in the conversation history the model reads back:

> ⚠️ The attached images were not processed: the active model does not support image input.

## Opening files back out of the chat

- **Non-image attachments** show up in the chat as a chip with the file's name (`📄 filename` in the Console, just the name in the home). Tapping it opens the file in your phone's system viewer (the same "open with" mechanism Android uses everywhere), falling back to opening the file's URL in a new browser tab if the native bridge isn't available (this fallback only matters when debugging the WebUI from a desktop browser, not on the phone).
- **Images** — both attached and any inline in a message — open in an in-app lightbox with pinch-to-zoom, since normal browser/page pinch-zoom is disabled across the whole app. Close with the "×", by tapping the background, or with Esc on a physical keyboard.
- **From the file browser** (workshop: Memory drawer → **The real files**), long-pressing (about 600 ms) any file opens a context sheet with: **Open with system app**, **Share** (the normal Android share sheet), **Save to Downloads** (copies the file into your phone's public Downloads folder), **Rename**, **Clone**, and **Delete**. Images opened directly (not long-pressed) go to the same in-app lightbox, with the same three actions available from its action bar.

## Honesty: things that can surprise you

- **Going over a limit is refused, out loud.** If you try to attach a 5th image, a 2nd video, a 5th other file, or a file bigger than its size cap, the composer does not add it and says which limit it hit — a toast in the workshop, a line in the chat in the home ("Too many images in one message", "The file is too large", "I couldn't open this file" if the phone could not read it). Files already in the pending list stay. If you expected 5 images and only see 4, that's why.
- **If the gateway rejects a message** (for example because the payload is malformed or the two sides disagree on a limit), you get the same kind of plain sentence in your language, not the internal `image_rejected` token, and the message is treated as not sent: your text comes back into the box, but the attachments do not, since the rejection covers the whole batch. A reason the app has no wording for shows as "Something went wrong" with the code in brackets.
- **There are three buckets, and the phone enforces all three.** Images (4), video (1) and other files (4) are counted separately, and the composer's video limit matches the gateway's: a second video is turned away on the phone, before anything is sent.
- **The WebView suspends background fetches when the screen is off or the phone is in Doze.** If you're waiting on an attachment to load or upload and the screen has gone dark, don't be surprised if nothing happens until you wake the phone.
