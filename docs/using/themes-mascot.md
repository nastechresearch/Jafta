# Themes and mascot

Jafta's look (the color theme and the on-screen mascot) is personal to the phone you're using: none of it is backed up or synced.

## Themes

Open the home's **Settings** page and the first card, **Theme**, holds a row of pills: each one is a three-colour swatch (background, surface, accent) with the theme's short name. Tap a pill to switch instantly; the app doesn't ask for confirmation and there's nothing to save. The card shows the full name of the active theme and a one-line description of it.

<p align="center"><img src="../img/themes.png" alt="The Settings page with the theme card, Synthwave '84 selected" width="300"></p>

There are seven named themes:

| Theme | Scheme | Feel |
|---|---|---|
| Chanel | Dark | Black and white couture, a thread of gold only where it counts |
| Synthwave '84 | Dark (default) | Neon pink on near-black |
| Jafta Kyoto | Dark | Earth, rust, hand-rounded edges |
| Jafta Sticker | Dark | Cut-out sticker look, white borders, hard shadows |
| Jafta Fumetto | Light | Ink on paper, comic-panel replies |
| Jafta Y2K | Light | Glossy gradients, bubblegum gloss |
| Jafta Pietra | Light | Travertine, bronze, Roman serifs |

Synthwave '84 is what a fresh install starts with. Whichever theme you pick, the app applies it before the very first paint on later launches, so there's no flash of the wrong colors.

On Android, the status bar and navigation bar follow your theme automatically — their background color and icon color (light or dark) are kept in sync with whichever theme is active, so a light theme like Jafta Pietra gets dark system-bar icons and a dark theme like Synthwave '84 gets light ones. This only happens inside the Jafta app itself; if you ever open the WebUI in a regular desktop or mobile browser instead of the Android app, the system bars obviously stay whatever your browser or OS already uses.

Your theme choice lives in the WebView's local storage on this specific device, not in `config.json`. That has two consequences worth knowing up front:

- It does **not** travel with an [encrypted backup](backup.md) — a `.jbk` file restores your conversations, memory, and settings, but not which theme card you last tapped.
- Reinstalling the app, or clearing the app's storage, resets the theme back to Synthwave '84. This is expected, not a bug.

## Mascot

A small companion (Jafta, styled as "✿") follows the conversation from the corner of the screen. On the home's chat page she is simply present beside the conversation, and a tap sends her to the edge or brings her back out; she comes back the way you left her. Everywhere else — the home's other pages (Apps, Notebooks, Settings) and the rooms opened from them, and every view of the workshop except the Console — she lives docked at the edge: tap her, or swipe her inward from the edge, and she pops out with a one-turn minichat, a text field ("Ask here…") and a speech bubble for the reply.

A few things about that minichat are worth knowing before you rely on it:

- Replies are capped at **280 characters** and stripped down to plain text — no markdown, no code blocks, no formatting survives.
- It talks over the **same conversation** as your main chat. Anything you ask the mascot lands in the same history the main chat sees, so a question you type into the minichat can come back up later if you ask Jafta to recall the conversation.
- The mascot gets **no automatic awareness of which screen you're on** — nothing about the current view is silently attached to what you type to her. Jafta does have a pull-based tool that can fetch the HTML of whatever's open (chat, Wiki, Workspace, apps, settings) when she decides it's relevant, but that tool works the same way regardless of whether you asked through the mascot's minichat or the main chat box — so talking to her isn't any blinder than talking in chat, it's just never handed screen context for free.

While waiting for a reply she switches between a "thinking" pose and, once text starts streaming back, a "talking" pose with an animated mouth. If you leave her alone reading a long reply she quiets back down into "thinking" after about a second of no new text.

Once a reply is done she reacts to it for 12 seconds: **happy, sad or angry**. The reaction comes from the emoji she wrote in that reply — her own signature four, 😏 😈 💅 🤭 (the ones her character sheet gives her), or any of the smiles and hearts, make her happy, a 😔 or a 💔 sad, a 😤 or a 😒 angry. When a reply mixes them, the most frequent wins, and on a tie the last one: the tone of a reply is at its end. Emoji inside code or in quoted lines don't count, and neither do ambiguous ones (🤔, 😅, or her own 🙄 and 😭, which are tone rather than mood) or things that aren't feelings (☀️, 🍝) — a reply without an emotional emoji shows no face at all. Nothing is asked of the model, so it costs nothing and works with any model and in any language. Errors make her sad on their own. She reacts *after* speaking, never while. `agents.defaults.mascotMood` in `config.json` turns it off — see [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md).

Her face and her body are two separate drawings stacked on each other, which is why an expression can ride on top of any pose rather than being a pose of its own. It works at the docked edge too, where she is seen from the side: the same happy, sad and angry faces are drawn in profile, over her side pose.

Drag her instead of tapping and she takes flight: she hangs from your finger with a bit of pendulum physics, and on release falls, bounces, gets up, and walks back home to her docked position. It's a pure fidget interaction with no functional effect — dragging her doesn't send anything or change any setting.

Her preferences are on the home's **Settings** page, in the row named after her (**Jafta** unless you gave her another name):

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Show mascot | on / off | On |
| Mascot size | Small / Medium / Large | Small |
| Floating mascot | on / off (Android only) | Off |

The same screen holds **Her name** (up to 40 characters). The Settings row, the chat page and the other places that name her follow it, and changing it erases nothing she remembers. Under the mascot settings sits **The rules you gave her**: a text of yours, up to 2,000 characters, that she reads every turn and never rewrites — Dream included. Both have their own **Save** button.

**Floating mascot** puts her in a window above other apps: tap her there to talk, and the answer comes in a bubble, in the same conversation as the app. It needs Android's "Display over other apps" permission, and the page tells you when that is missing.

Size is the side of the square she occupies — 120, 160 or 210 px; she starts small. The rest of her geometry follows from it, including where the minichat bubble sits relative to her head, so she stays coherent at every size rather than growing out of her own speech balloon.

Which edge she docks on is not a setting: she always docks on the right, and after a throw she walks back there.

She comes in one look, in color. There used to be a black-and-white switch here, drawn from a second set of line-art artwork; it was retired when her expressions were drawn, because keeping both meant drawing every expression twice.

Like the theme, **Show mascot** and **Mascot size** are stored in this device's local storage, not in `config.json` and not in your encrypted backup. A reinstall brings her back showing and small. **Floating mascot** is the exception: it lives in `config.json` (`floating.enabled`), because the window is started by the app's background service, which can't read the WebView's storage.

If your phone has "reduce motion" turned on at the OS level, Jafta respects it: the animated mouth-flap while she talks is skipped in favor of a static pose. The drag-to-fly gesture itself is a direct manipulation you control with your finger, so it still works if you choose to use it.

## UI language

The interface exists in two languages: Italian and English. It follows the phone's system language, checking an exact match first and then just the language prefix; for any other language it falls back to English. There is no language switch inside the app: to change it, change the phone's language.

This is worth separating clearly from a similarly named setting:

- **UI language** only controls what the buttons, labels, and toasts in the WebUI say.
- **`agents.defaults.language`** is a `config.json` field, and the *only* place that writes it is the onboarding wizard. It captures the UI language active when you set the phone up, and uses it for a handful of backend-generated strings (like the initial welcome message).

Changing the phone's language later does **not** touch `agents.defaults.language`. Any backend-generated text that depends on that field keeps using the language you had during onboarding until you edit `config.json` directly; see [Configuration](../reference/configuration.md). Several backend error messages (settings validation, some model-list failures) are in English regardless of either.

None of this affects what language Jafta actually *replies* to you in during a normal conversation: that depends on the language model you're using and how you write to it, not on any setting in this app.
