# Slash commands

Typing a message that starts with `/` in the chat input can trigger a built-in command instead of a normal turn. You don't have to remember any of them in the workshop, where the **Commands** chip above the Console's composer lists them all with a one-line description each, and picking one either sends it or fills the composer in for you. The home has no such chip: its composer is only the paperclip, the text box and the send button, so there every command is typed by hand. Here is the full list and exactly what each one prints.

## How commands work

Commands are matched on the whole message (case-insensitive), either as an exact word (`/new`) or as a prefix followed by an argument (`/model fast`). If what you type doesn't match any known command, it is **not rejected** — it's forwarded to the agent as an ordinary chat message, exactly as if it had no leading slash.

You can type them by hand — the only way in the home — or, in the workshop's Console, pick them from the **Commands** chip in the row above the composer, next to the scope chip and the write switch. That list is built from the same table that `/help` prints, so it can't drift out of date; a command that takes an argument (`/model`, `/history`, `/goal`, …) is written into the composer for you instead of being sent immediately, so you can finish the line. There is still no autocomplete on `/` itself. Typing `/help` works everywhere, and is the way to see the list from the home.

## Where a command works

**The subject decides.** Each command acts on one of three things, and that is what says where it can be sent from:

| Acts on | Commands | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **this conversation** | `/new` `/stop` `/status` `/history` `/goal` `/help` | anywhere |
| **the personal memory, or the installation** | `/dream` `/model` `/skill` | the personal chat only |
| **this notebook** | `/gardener` `/tidy` `/init` | inside a [notebook](./projects.md) only |

Both halves are enforced, and both are visible: `/help` lists what this conversation can do — entering a notebook *removes* `/dream` and friends as well as adding `/tidy` — and the workshop's Commands chip shows the same list. Sending one anyway is refused with a line that says where it does work, and the refusal comes from the command layer: it never reaches the model as a message.

Two consequences worth naming. Working on a notebook is always done **from inside** it: no command takes a notebook name, the same way the journal tool has no argument to reach another notebook's journal. And on Telegram — always the personal conversation — the notebook commands simply do not exist.

Two commands — `/stop` and `/status` — are handled on a "priority" fast path that runs even while a turn is actively streaming or a tool is executing. The rest wait for the current dispatch to be free, which in practice is rarely noticeable.

All server-side command responses below are **hardcoded in English**, regardless of whether the WebUI is set to Italian or English. This is true for the confirmation text, the usage/error messages, and the `/status`/`/model` output.

## The server commands

| Command | Arguments | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/new` | none | Stops the active task (if any) and clears the model's context for a fresh conversation |
| `/stop` | none | Cancels the active agent turn for this chat |
| `/status` | none | Shows a runtime snapshot: version, model, token usage, context budget, session size, uptime, active tasks |
| `/model` | `[preset]` | Shows the current model/preset, or switches the active preset |
| `/history` | `[n]` | Prints the last `n` persisted user/assistant messages (default 10, max 50) |
| `/goal` | `<description>` | Tells the agent to treat the request as a long-running goal |
| `/dream` | none | Manually triggers a memory consolidation (Dream) run in the background |
| `/gardener` | none | Runs one [gardener](./gardener.md) pass on the notebook you are in, now |
| `/skill` | none | Lists the currently enabled skills with their descriptions |
| `/help` | none | Lists the commands of this conversation |

Two more, `/tidy` and `/init`, appear in the workshop's Commands chip and in `/help` but are not in the list above because they are not commands in the same sense: inside a [notebook](./projects.md) each is expanded into an ordinary agent turn — one restructures that notebook's wiki, the other writes its `AGENTS.md`. Outside a notebook they are refused like any other notebook command.

**The knobs are not here.** Dream's budgets and review cadence, and everything about the periodic gardener pass, used to be arguments of `/dream` and `/gardener`. They are settings, so they live in the workshop's **Memory** drawer — in the *Dream* and *Gardener* groups — next to the numbers they act on. Typing the old form answers with where it went.

Full details and exact output text for each command follow.

### `/new` — start a fresh conversation

Cancels any active task first, then clears the model's context (the LLM stops remembering everything before this point) and archives the discarded messages into long-term memory for later Dream processing. The response is rendered as a separator line in the chat, not a bubble:

```text
New session started.
```

There are three ways to run it. In the workshop Console: the **New chat** button in the composer (next to the paperclip), or the first entry in the Commands chip; both ask for confirmation first, since the reset can't be undone. In the home there is no button, so you type `/new` — and it is sent as it stands, with no confirmation. Typing `/new` works in both shells.

**The screen starts again from the separator.** The conversation before it is not deleted: the separator is a page break in the visible history, and scrolling up loads the previous session as an older page. Right after `/new` the screen is too short to scroll, so a **Show the previous conversation** button at the top does the same. That's true after closing and reopening the app too — the chat comes back starting at the last separator, not at the top of everything.

**And the model really does start empty.** Two things would otherwise leak back into the very next turn's system prompt through the `# Recent History` block ([the agent turn](../internals/agent-turn.md)): the summaries of any auto-compaction that happened during the cleared conversation, and the summary `/new` itself writes when archiving it. Neither is injected any more — a per-session floor covers the first, and the archived summary is marked as Dream-only for the second. Dream still consolidates both into long-term memory: `/new` resets what is *in front of* the model, and never deletes what it has already learned.

If a conversation seems to keep dragging in an old topic — or to ignore a rule you added to `AGENTS.md` halfway through, which it re-reads from disk on every turn — this is the command you want. A model imitates its own history, and the history is what `/new` takes away.

### `/stop` — cancel the active turn

While a turn runs, the home's send button turns into **Stop** and sends this command for you. The workshop Console has no stop button, so there typing `/stop` (or picking it from the Commands chip) is the way to interrupt a turn that's in progress. It works specifically because it's on the priority fast path (it's processed even mid-turn, before the normal dispatch lock). Response:

```text
Stopped N task(s).
```

or, if nothing was running:

```text
No active task to stop.
```

`/stop` also cancels an active `/goal` and discards any subagent working in the background for this chat — a subagent that finishes after being stopped has its result silently thrown away.

### `/status` — runtime snapshot

No arguments. Output is a fixed-format block (rendered as plain text, not markdown), for example:

```text
🐈 jafta v1.0.0
🧠 Model: gpt-4o
📊 Tokens: 1234 in / 567 out (40% cached)
📚 Context: 12k/65k (22% of input budget)
💬 Session: 48 messages
⏱ Uptime: 2h 14m
⚡ Tasks: 0 active
```

The cached-percentage part of the token line only appears when the last turn actually used cached tokens. "% of input budget" is the context estimate divided by (context window − max output tokens − a small safety margin), not divided by the raw context window. `/status` and `/stop` are the two commands that work even while a turn is running.

### `/model [preset]` — show or switch model preset

Without an argument, shows the current state:

```text
## Model
- Current model: `gpt-4o`
- Current preset: `default`
- Available presets: `default`, `fast`, `deep`
```

`default` is always available and reflects the plain `agents.defaults.*` model fields; named presets come from `modelPresets` in `config.json` — there is no UI for creating presets, they exist only in the config file. See [Configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md#modelpresets).

With one argument, it switches presets for future turns and confirms:

```text
Switched model preset to `fast`.
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Context window: 65536
- Max output tokens: 4096
```

If the name doesn't match a configured preset:

```text
Could not switch model preset: <error detail>

Available presets: `default`, `fast`, `deep`
```

If you pass more than one word:

```text
Usage: `/model [preset]`
```

Switching is **runtime-only**: it does not rewrite `config.json`, and a turn that is already in progress keeps using the model it started with.

### `/history [n]` — print recent messages

Shows the last `n` persisted user/assistant messages from the current session. Default `n` is 10, maximum is 50 (a value above 50 is silently capped, not rejected). Each message is truncated to 200 characters with a trailing `…`.

```text
Last 10 message(s):
👤 You: what's the weather like today?
🤖 Bot: It's sunny and 22°C where you are right now.
```

If there's nothing to show:

```text
No conversation history yet.
```

If the argument isn't a number:

```text
Usage: /history [count] — e.g. /history 5 (default: 10, max: 50)
```

This reads the persisted session history, not the on-screen transcript: the two are separate, and `/new` resets the first without deleting the second.

### `/goal <description>` — start a long-running goal

Rewrites your message into a normal agent turn that instructs the model to register a sustained objective (via the internal `long_task` tool) instead of answering as a one-shot request. There's no separate "goal view" — it's the same chat, with normal turns, but the objective stays pinned in the agent's context (so it survives compaction) and the per-turn timeout is disabled until it's done. A banner with a running timer appears while a turn is in progress.

Without a description:

```text
Usage: /goal <long-running task description>
```

If a task is already running in this chat:

```text
A task is already running for this chat. Use `/stop` first, then send `/goal <long-running task description>` again.
```

Only one goal can be active per chat at a time. The agent closes it itself (or you can cancel with `/stop`); an inactive goal also expires automatically after 12 hours.

### `/dream` — run memory consolidation now

Triggers Dream (the long-term memory consolidation job) in the background. It replies immediately:

```text
Dreaming...
```

and later, once the run finishes, with a separate message giving the outcome — one of:

```text
Dream completed in 4.2s.
```
```text
Dream completed in 4.2s but consolidated nothing from its batch (no memory file grew); memory cursor was not advanced, so those entries come back next run.
```
```text
Dream completed in 4.2s but wrote nothing (attempts blocked/refused); memory cursor was not advanced.
```
```text
Dream did not complete after 4.2s; memory cursor was not advanced.
```
```text
Dream failed after 4.2s: <error>
```

Dream runs one cycle at a time. If one is already going (the periodic one, or an earlier `/dream`), the command does not start a second and answers instead of `Dreaming...` with:

```text
A Dream cycle is already running, so this one did not start — Dream runs one cycle at a time, or both take the same batch off the same cursor and each pays for its own review pass. Nothing would be lost, only spent twice. Try again once it has finished.
```

Every so often the run begins with a **memory review pass** (see [Memory and Dream](./memory.md)). When it does, its result is written as a line in front of the outcome, in the same message, for example `A memory review pass ran first and freed 1,240 chars across MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md.`, or `…ran first; nothing was freed across…`, or `…ran first but did not complete cleanly…`. It can go on to say that some writes were refused by their size budget and never landed (the Memory drawer shows which file is full), and that facts were moved into `memory/archive/`, naming their ids so you can find them again with `recall`.

If there's no new history to process yet (common on a fresh or short chat, since Dream only reads from `memory/history.jsonl`, which is only populated after compaction), you get a longer explanation instead, ending with suggestions like enabling `idleCompactAfterMinutes`. See [Memory and Dream](./memory.md) for the full model.

The command takes no arguments. The three file budgets, the review cadence, and Dream's own schedule are in the workshop's **Memory** drawer (*How much she remembers* and *Dream*), which also shows what each file currently measures — the number the budget is chosen from. `/dream budget …` answers with a line saying so.

### `/gardener` — run a gardener pass on this notebook

Inside a [notebook](./projects.md), `/gardener` runs one [gardener](./gardener.md) pass on that notebook right now: it acknowledges with `Gardening <name>...` and follows up when the pass finishes. It takes no arguments — the notebook you are in *is* the subject.

Outside a notebook it is refused, and the refusal says to open one. There is no way to garden a notebook from the personal chat: that is deliberate, and it matches the tool layer, where the journal has no argument for reaching another notebook either. (The command layer's English texts still call a notebook a *project*, its older name: see the refusal quoted under `/init` below.)

The periodic pass — whether it runs at all, how often it looks, how much silence it waits for, how long before it returns to the same notebook — is in the workshop's **Memory** drawer, in the *Gardener* group. Turning it off there leaves `/gardener` working by hand. `/gardener settings` and the other old words answer with a line saying where they went.

### `/tidy` — restructure this notebook's wiki

Only inside a notebook, and like `/init` it is not answered by the command layer: it becomes a full agent turn, in this conversation, with the notebook's pages and your answers in hand. It splits pages that have outgrown the per-turn budget, moves prose out of an oversized map, and realigns the page list — the operation a periodic gardener pass cannot do, because it has nobody to ask. If the wiki is already in good shape it says so in one line and changes nothing.

### `/init` — write this notebook's instructions

Only inside a notebook. Unlike everything else on this page it is not answered by the command layer: it is expanded into a full agent turn that reads `wiki/index.md`, the pages, the recent `log/` entries and the existing instructions file, and then writes that notebook's `AGENTS.md` — scope, the conventions the pages already follow, and the open questions. If the file already has content it is updated rather than replaced. What you see in the chat stays `/init`.

Outside a notebook, the same refusal every notebook command gives. The server still words it with the older name, *project*, and mentions the chip that only the workshop has; in the home the equivalent is the **Notebooks** page:

```text
`/init` works on one project, and this conversation is not a project.

Open the project — the chip above the composer does it — and send `/init` there.
```

The other direction is refused the same way: `/dream`, `/model` or `/skill` sent from inside a notebook answer that the command does not act on this project and should be sent from the personal chat.

### `/skill` — list enabled skills

```text
Available skills (3):

- **weather** — Look up current weather and forecasts.
- **app-creator** — Guide the user through building a new Jafta App.
- **llm-wiki** — Maintain the workspace wiki (scaffold, ingest, compile).
```

or, if none are enabled:

```text
No skills available.
```

### `/help` — list the commands of this conversation

In the personal chat:

```text
✿ jafta commands:
/new — Stop the current task and start a fresh conversation.
/stop — Cancel the active agent turn for this chat.
/status — Display runtime, provider, and channel status.
/model [preset] — Show or switch the active model preset.
/history [n] — Print the last N persisted conversation messages.
/goal <goal> — Tell the agent to treat the request as a long-running goal.
/dream — Manually trigger memory consolidation now. The budgets and the review cadence live in Settings → Workshop → Memory.
/skill — List enabled skills and their descriptions.
/help — List available slash commands.
```

Inside a notebook the list is a different one, not a longer one: `/dream`, `/model` and `/skill` drop out, and `/gardener`, `/tidy` and `/init` appear.

## What `/new` does and does not delete

`/new` is a reset of the model's context, not a delete button — nothing is destroyed on the server:

| | What happens |
|---|---|
| The model's context | Cleared. It stops remembering anything before the separator. |
| The visible chat | Starts again from the separator. Scroll up to reach the previous session; reopening the app shows the same thing. |
| The persisted transcript | Untouched — it is a separate, permanent log, and the page break only changes where reading starts. |
| Long-term memory | Untouched. The discarded conversation is archived for Dream, which will consolidate it into `MEMORY.md` as usual. |

If you want a conversation to actually go away, deleting it is a different operation: a [notebook](./projects.md) and its conversation are removed together (in the home, press and hold its row in **Notebooks** and choose **Delete**; in the workshop, tap the bin on its row in the scope chip or use the file manager), and the personal conversation's transcript lives in the workspace.

> **A note for anyone upgrading.** There used to be a `/clear` command, undocumented in `/help` and handled entirely inside the WebUI: it wiped the screen, printed `Chat cleared.` and left the model's context completely intact. It gave a convincing confirmation for something it had not done — the model went on remembering everything — and it was the first thing most people tried. It has been removed. Typing `/clear` now just sends an ordinary message to the agent; the command you want is `/new`.

## Periodic tasks (HEARTBEAT.md)

This is unrelated to slash commands but shares the same "plain files, no terminal" spirit: Jafta also runs a periodic check every 30 minutes (`gateway.heartbeat.intervalS`, default 1800) driven by `workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`. It only acts on lines under a `## Active Tasks` heading; everything else in the file is ignored. You can edit that file directly from the workshop's **Memory** drawer (**The real files**), or just ask Jafta in chat to "add a periodic task" and she'll update it for you. This job shows up in the agent's internal job list as `heartbeat`, but it's system-managed and can't be removed the way a normal reminder can; to disable it you'd set `gateway.heartbeat.enabled` to `false` in `config.json` and restart the app (there is no in-app toggle for it). See [Scheduling and proactivity](./scheduling.md) for the full picture, including the cost-per-cycle caveat and reliability limits.
