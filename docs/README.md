# Jafta documentation

Jafta is a local-first AI agent that runs as an Android APK. These docs are written in English; the app's own UI is bilingual (Italian/English) and switches with your device language.

## Using Jafta

Start here if you just want to install and use the app.

### Start here

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| [Introduction](start/introduction.md) | What Jafta is — a local Android agent, BYOK, one conversation thread, persistent memory, proactivity — and the prerequisites before you install it. |
| [Install the APK](start/install.md) | Downloading and verifying the signed APK from GitHub Releases (or building it from source instead), the permissions it asks for, and what it means that it also registers as a HOME launcher. |
| [First run](start/first-run.md) | What happens on first boot, what gets created on disk, and the 4-step onboarding wizard that connects your provider. |
| [Set it as your launcher](start/launcher-setup.md) | Setting Jafta as your Android home screen (or undoing it), and the honest take on using it as a daily launcher. |
| [Is Jafta for you?](start/is-jafta-for-you.md) | Who this project is built for, and who it probably isn't. |

### Using Jafta

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| [Tour of the WebUI](using/webui-tour.md) | The home's swipeable pages (Apps, Jafta, Notebooks, Settings), the workshop's four-tab dock (Console, Brain, Hands, Memory), Android back-button behavior, and the session info popover. |
| [Chat basics](using/chat.md) | Sending messages, streaming replies, tool call pills, the reasoning block, the changed-files pill, and inline file previews. |
| [Files and attachments](using/attachments.md) | Sending images, files, and camera captures from chat; the exact size limits and what the model actually gets to see. |
| [Memory and Dream](using/memory.md) | How session history, idle compaction, and the two-phase Dream consolidation build Jafta's long-term memory — and how the list of your wikis reaches every prompt. |
| [Notebooks](using/projects.md) | Notebook conversations: a chat bound to one folder that remembers by writing pages, and passes only facts about you on to Jafta's personal memory — the scope chip, the Writes/Read-only switch, capture, and the map. |
| [The gardener](using/gardener.md) | The background pass that turns a notebook's journal lines into pages and keeps its map true: when it runs, what it refuses to touch, and how to turn it off. |
| [Scheduling and proactivity](using/scheduling.md) | Reminders (one-shot, recurring, cron), the heartbeat loop, goals/long tasks, and subagents — and what silently breaks when the app is killed. |
| [Mini-apps (Jafta Apps)](using/mini-apps.md) | Chat-authored mini web apps backed by native tools, how they differ from skills, and their sandboxing limits. |
| [Skills](using/skills.md) | Markdown-based skill folders that extend agent behavior in chat, where to see and switch them, and why built-in ones can't be switched off. |
| [Themes and mascot](using/themes-mascot.md) | The 7 UI themes, the mascot's interactions and preferences, and UI language vs. agent language. |
| [SSH access](using/ssh.md) | Registering your own remote machines, generating the on-device key, pinning host fingerprints, short commands vs detached jobs — and why a restore doesn't bring SSH access back. |
| [Telegram bridge](using/telegram.md) | Pairing and using the optional Telegram bridge alongside the WebUI, and what does and doesn't work over it. |
| [Location](using/location.md) | How device location is shared with the model as context, the two-gate permission model, and the privacy trade-off. |
| [Backup and restore](using/backup.md) | Encrypted `.jbk` backups (for disaster recovery) vs. local workspace snapshots (a time machine), and how to restore either. |
| [Phone app launcher](using/app-launcher.md) | The search drawer that opens your phone's apps and mini-apps, and the card a long press on a row opens, for app info, uninstalling, editing and deleting. |
| [Wiki](using/wiki.md) | The knowledge base Jafta compiles on request: its pages and map, editing a page, and reporting one. |
| [Slash commands](using/slash-commands.md) | Built-in commands like `/new` and `/stop`, where each one works (this conversation, the personal chat, or inside a notebook), the Commands chip that lists them, and how unrecognized commands fall through to the LLM. |
| [Troubleshooting](using/troubleshooting.md) | Diagnosing common on-device symptoms — offline dot, silent errors, missed reminders, silent Telegram, blocked URLs. |

### Reference
