This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working with this repository.

## Project Overview

Jafta is a lightweight AI agent framework written in Python with a built-in mobile-first WebUI served from `jafta/templates/ui/`. It centers around an async agent loop that receives messages over WebSocket, invokes an LLM provider, executes tools, and manages session memory.

**Android is the only runtime target.**

## Development Commands

```bash
pytest tests/config/ -v
ruff check jafta/
```

The gateway is started by the Android runtime via `jafta.android_entry.run_gateway()`.

## Android Build & Deploy

The Android project lives in the `android/` directory.

**Every on-device test runs on the Android emulator `jafta_square`** (AVD: 1440×1440 @ 480 dpi,
arm64, android-37), and only there. Do not install on, uninstall from or test against any
other device, even when one shows up in `adb devices`: pin the emulator with
`ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554` on every `adb`/Gradle command.

```bash
~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -avd jafta_square -no-snapshot-save &
adb devices -l   # emulator-5554 must be listed
cd android && ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5554 ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk ./gradlew app:installDebug
```

Debug and release APKs are signed differently: switching between them on the emulator needs
`adb uninstall com.nastechresearch.jafta` first, which wipes the emulator's workspace — and brings
back the first-run onboarding, which is often exactly what a test wants.

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Data Flow

Messages flow through an async `MessageBus` (`jafta/bus/queue.py`) that decouples the WebSocket channel from the agent core:

1. **WebSocket Channel** (`jafta/channels/websocket.py`) receives messages from the mobile WebUI and publishes `InboundMessage` events to the bus.
2. **`AgentLoop`** (`jafta/agent/loop.py`) consumes inbound messages, builds context, and coordinates the turn.
3. **`AgentRunner`** (`jafta/agent/runner.py`) handles the actual LLM conversation loop: send messages to the provider, receive tool calls, execute tools, and stream responses.
4. Responses are published as `OutboundMessage` events back to the WebSocket channel.

### Key Subsystems

- **Agent Loop** (`jafta/agent/loop.py`, `runner.py`): The core processing engine. `AgentLoop` manages session keys, hooks, and context building. `AgentRunner` executes the multi-turn LLM conversation with tool execution.
- **LLM Providers** (`jafta/providers/`): Provider implementations (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, OpenAI Responses API converters) built on a common base (`base.py`). `factory.py` creates the provider from config.
- **Channel** (`jafta/channels/`): four channel classes — WebSocket (`websocket.py`, the WebUI), Telegram (`telegram.py`, a paired personal-bot channel), Notification (`notification.py`, a reply typed into an Android notification, answered with a system alert) and Floating (`floating.py`, the floating mascot's bubble); the last two exist only on Android. `dispatcher.py` owns them and routes outbound bus messages to whichever are active (retry, delta coalescing, progress filtering). All four feed the same unified session. Other platform integrations were removed from this fork.
- **Tools** (`jafta/agent/tools/`): Agent capabilities exposed to the LLM: filesystem (read/write/edit/list), `python_exec` for code execution, Android web search/fetch (`android_web.py`), cron, subagent spawning, long-running tasks / sustained goals (`long_task.py`), and self-modification. Tools are explicitly registered: `loader.py` imports a fixed module list of 23 (`_HARDCODED_TOOL_MODULES`) and each module declares `TOOLS = [...]`, yielding 41 tool classes. **Three more bypass the loader**, each because it needs a live reference the loader cannot provide: `my` (the running `AgentLoop`), `memory` (`MemoryEntryTool`, which needs the memory store) and the per-app action tool (synced per turn) — so this list is not a complete inventory of the tool surface, and `self.py`/`memory_entries.py` declaring no usable `TOOLS` is deliberate rather than an oversight. A name collision — like a module without `TOOLS`, or an `allow` entry that names no known tool — raises `ToolLoadError` and aborts startup; a failing `enabled()`/`create()` only disables that one tool, logged at ERROR and recorded in `ToolLoader.failures`.
- **Memory** (`jafta/agent/memory.py`): Session history persistence with Dream two-phase memory consolidation. Uses atomic writes with fsync for durability.
- **Session Management** (`jafta/session/`): History persistence, context compaction, and sustained goal state tracking (`goal_state.py`); TTL-based auto-compaction lives in `jafta/agent/autocompact.py` (`AutoCompact`). The user conversation is a **single unified session** (`unified:default`, see `keys.py`), except that a project chat on the WebSocket channel gets its own `project:<name>` session (`session_key_for_channel`); internal work (cron, Dream, heartbeat) uses separate internal keys via `session_key_override`.
- **Config** (`jafta/config/schema.py`, `loader.py`, `store.py`): Pydantic-*style* configuration (`jafta/pydantic_compat/`, stdlib-only — see [`FORK_BOUNDARY.md`](./FORK_BOUNDARY.md)) loaded from `workspace/config.json` inside the project root. Supports camelCase aliases for JSON compatibility. **Every write goes through `store.mutate()`** — see the rule under [Config & security](#config--security); calling `save_config()` directly reintroduces a silent data-loss bug that no test will catch for you.
- **WebUI** (`jafta/templates/ui/`): Mobile-first HTML/JS served by the gateway, in two shells that share `assets/shared/`: the home (`index.html` + `home-*.js`, the default) and the workshop (`workshop.html` + `mobile-*.js`), reached from the home's Settings page; `onboarding.html` is a third, first-run document. Both shells talk to the gateway over the same WebSocket used for chat, plus HTTP routes under `/api/`.
- **WebUI HTTP API** (`jafta/webui/`): The `/api/` route handlers backing the SPA (apps, settings, media, skills, transcript, token usage, workspaces, file preview, etc.), plus gateway service/token wiring.
- **Jafta Apps** (`jafta/apps/`): Runtime for user-authored mini-apps — `manifest.py`, `executor.py`, `storage.py`, `summary.py`, `http.py`, `proxy.py`, `token.py`. See [Write a mini-app](docs/contribute/write-a-mini-app.md).
- **Command Router** (`jafta/command/`): Slash command routing and built-in command handlers.
- **Heartbeat** (`jafta/templates/HEARTBEAT.md`): Periodic task list checked via `cron` jobs.
- **Skills** (`jafta/skills/`): Built-in skill definitions loaded into agent context.
- **Security** (`jafta/security/`): Workspace policy/access + network SSRF protections.

### Gateway Entry Point

- **Gateway**: `jafta/android_entry.py::run_gateway()` → `gateway_runtime._run_gateway()` (thin, patchable) → **`jafta/runtime/container.py::GatewayContainer`**, the explicit composition root that builds the whole object graph and owns runtime state (onboarding-deferred agent creation, ordered shutdown drain).
- **Runtime state**: `jafta/runtime/context.py::RuntimeContext` is the single source of truth for workspace dir / Android context / config-path override (accessors `get_workspace_path`, `get_android_context`, `get_config_path` delegate here — no scattered module globals).
- **Cron/delivery**: `jafta/runtime/cron_dispatch.py::CronDispatcher`, `jafta/runtime/delivery.py::ChannelDeliverer`.

### Decomposed subsystems (mixins/leaf modules)

Large classes are split into focused mixins/leaf modules composed via MRO (behavior-identical): `AgentLoop` ← `turn_states`/`turn_persistence`/`loop_provider`/`loop_tasks` (+ `turn_types`); `AgentRunner` ← `request_execution`/`tool_execution` (+ `context_governor`, `usage_accounting`, `history_repair`, `tool_error_policy`); `OpenAICompatProvider` ← `openai_compat_parsing` (+ `openai_compat_helpers`); `AnthropicProvider` ← `anthropic_conversion`; `WebSocketChannel` ← `ws_sender` (+ `ws_parsing`); `transcript` → `transcript_store`/`transcript_recorder`/`transcript_replay`/`transcript_markdown`/`transcript_tool_events`; `ws_http` → `*_routes` families.

### Config & security

- **Never write `config.json` outside `config/store.py::mutate()`.** It reads the file *inside* the lock it writes under, so no caller can hold a stale copy; `save_config()` rewrites the whole file, so a stale copy silently erases whatever another writer just changed. Slow I/O (network, subprocess) belongs **before** entering `mutate`, never inside the callback — the lock is held for its whole duration. `mutate` also carries through keys this version's schema does not know, keeps a `.bak`, writes atomically and restores `chmod 600`; none of that happens if you bypass it. Two documented exceptions, both commented on the spot: `config/bootstrap.py` (runs before the event loop) and any wholesale restore.
- `config/schema.py::SecurityConfig` (`config.security`) is the canonical home for `restrict_to_workspace`/`ssrf_whitelist`. Only `restrict_to_workspace` is mirrored onto `ToolsConfig` for the tool layer — `ssrf_whitelist` lives on `SecurityConfig` alone, and writing `tools.ssrf_whitelist` is silently dropped. A validator migrates legacy config.
- `config/runtime_env.py` is the single layer for operational `JAFTA_*` env knobs.
- Tools are registered via an explicit `TOOLS = [...]` list per module (read by `agent/tools/loader.py`); name collisions and missing `TOOLS` raise `ToolLoadError` at startup, a failing `enabled()`/`create()` disables only that tool.

## Project-Specific Notes

Working notes (plans, checklists, reviews) live in a local `.agent/` folder that is not
versioned: a clone does not have it, so never cite it from code, tests or `docs/`, and put the
reason in the comment itself. The public references are
[Security model](docs/internals/security-model.md) for the security boundaries,
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the design rules and
[`FORK_BOUNDARY.md`](./FORK_BOUNDARY.md) for what this fork keeps and drops.

- **Design boards are not in the repo.** Some code comments cite «tavole» — design boards
  such as `Quaderno.dc.html` or the artifact *Jafta UI: Utente e Operatore* — that lived
  outside the repository. Where a comment and the code disagree, the code wins. Do not go
  looking for the files, and do not cite a board as the only justification for a new decision.
- **`docs/` has a second consumer outside this repo.** The website
  (`nastechresearch/jafta-site`) generates its `/docs/**` routes from these files at build
  time, deriving each page's title from the `# H1` and its sidebar position from the
  `docs/<section>/` folder. So moving, renaming or re-nesting a file under `docs/`
  changes a public URL and the site's navigation — it is not a repo-local edit. The
  content itself stays canonical here: the site holds no copy.

## Code Style

- Python 3.11+, asyncio throughout.
- Line length: 100.
- Linting: `ruff` with rules E, F, I, N, W (E501 ignored).
- pytest with `asyncio_mode = "auto"`.
- Language convention: every Markdown file under `jafta/` (skills, their references, prompt templates) is English only — examples, frontmatter and `{# … #}` Jinja comments included — because the model reads them and imitates their language; `tests/skills/test_prompt_markdown_is_english.py` enforces it, and a bundled skill's localized `user_summary` lives in the i18n JSON (`skills.userSummary.<name>`). Otherwise, docstrings/comments in Italian for new code; inherited upstream code keeps English — do not translate existing text. Identifiers, log messages and commit-facing strings: English. User-facing WebUI strings are localized via i18n JSON files (`jafta/templates/ui/assets/i18n/{it,en}.json`), not hardcoded. "Identifiers" includes the WebUI's vocabulary — CSS classes, element ids, `data-*` attributes, i18n keys — and file names; the two shells are the home (`index.html`, `home-*.js`) and the workshop (`workshop.html`, `mobile-*.js`), and the home's own pages are `HomePages` while a notebook's pages are `NotebookPages`. A name that is persisted or on the wire (`config.json`, `localStorage`, an `/api/` field, an RPC, a `postMessage` type) does not change without a migration: see `Config._migrate_casa_to_home` and `RENAMED_KEYS` in `shared/mascot.js`.
